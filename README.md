Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of this product is done at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for consequential liability that is held for the data that the download contains.

### Use
This repo is meant to be hosted locally. The idea is to build it out to a production site but I don't think that's going to happen (@LilBibby_ @unnecessarilyballling). XMMP/Apache is required. Php is required. I planned to move this to mysql, but I still have yet to finish my mega download (20gb/170gb), and I've deleted everything on my pc but this. If you need help setting this up just dm me on twitter https://twitter.com/ykhwriuqitb.
